# Contribution Guidelines

This Project welcomes contributions, suggestions, and feedback. All contributions, suggestions, and feedback submitted are accepted under the [Project's license](./License.md) via Developerâ€™s Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO). Additionally, contributors represent that if they do not own copyright in the code, that they have the authority to submit each  contribution under the [Project's license](./License.md). All public feedback, suggestions, or contributions are not confidential.

Each Project repository will include information about the DCO in their CONTRIBUTING file, and will use automation, such as GitHub Actions, to ensure each contribution follows this.

Text to include in CONTRIBUTING files:

## Developer Certificate of Origin
The DCO is a declaration attached to every contribution made by every developer. In the commit message of the contribution, the developer simply adds a Signed-off-by statement and thereby agrees to the DCO, which you can find below or at [DeveloperCertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/).

We require that every contribution to this repository is signed with a Developer Certificate of Origin. Additionally, please use your real name. We do not accept anonymous contributors nor those utilizing pseudonyms.

Each commit must include a DCO which looks like this

Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@email.com>

You may type this line on your own when writing your commit messages. However, if your user.name and user.email are set in your git configs, you can use -s or --signoff to add the Signed-off-by line to the end of the commit message.
